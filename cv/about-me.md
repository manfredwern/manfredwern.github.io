My name is Manfred Wilhelm Werner.
I was born and raised in the Philippines but currently living in Germany.
I am on the journey to the world of Frontend development and I am liking it so far.


#### What I love to do

I have always been interested with photography. I find it as an art to express yourself and that every detail matters. But what I like the most is the beauty of surpise that you could capture without even knowing it in the beginning. It is the same thing as coding, you just start with an idea but it evolves into something more beautiful.
