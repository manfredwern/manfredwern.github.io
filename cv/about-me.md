Hi! Welcome. I am glad you are here. Let me introduce myself.

``` bash
npx @manfredwern/about-me/init@latest init manfredwern
```

My name is Manfred Werner. My first steps revolved around `JavaScript` and `CSS`. This awakened my interest in Web Design and now I am on the journey to the world of Frontend Development.


Let us explore more about me.

``` bash
cd manfredwern
npm run start manfredwern
```

## Lifecycle hooks

I have always wondered what was happening behind computer screens and how programming connects us to machines. This developed into a passion. Using code to solve problems and seeing new ideas coming to life in the browser enhances my motivation to dig into Frontend Development. 

`Angular` was a big step in my career to enhance my skills and to deeply involve myself into the creation of web applications. Because I am a curious person by nature my goal is to discover what other frameworks and languages I can learn to develop new ideas. 

As of now, I am currently adding another programming language to my knowledge, which is `Python`. As a self-learner, if I am not developing my coding skills, you will find me exploring new places and taking photos. 

## Internationalization

Going back in time, these are the first languages I learnt: 

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="english"
  values={[
    {label: 'English', value: 'english'},
    {label: 'German', value: 'german'},
    {label: 'Tagalog', value: 'tagalog'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="english">ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ &nbsp; Hello, let's code together!  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="german">ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª &nbsp; Hallo, lass uns zusammen codieren! </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="tagalog">ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­  &nbsp; Kumusta, magkasama tayong mag-code! </TabItem>
</Tabs>
