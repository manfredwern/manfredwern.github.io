Hi! I am glad that you are here. Let us get start started by introducing myself.

``` bash
npx @manfredwern/about-me/init@latest init manfredwern
```

My name is Manfred Wilhelm Werner.
I was born and raised in the Philippines but currently living in Germany.
I am on the journey to the world of Frontend development and I am liking it so far.


Now let's explore more about me.

```
cd manfredwern
npm run start
```

### More about me

I have always been interested with photography. I find it as an art to express yourself and that every detail matters. But what I like the most is the beauty of surpise that you could capture without even knowing it in the beginning. It is the same thing as coding, you just start with an idea but it evolves into something more beautiful.

## Supported Languages

Being raised in a mixed culture, I am blessed to know these multiple languages. 

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="english"
  values={[
    {label: 'English', value: 'english'},
    {label: 'German', value: 'german'},
    {label: 'Tagalog', value: 'tagalog'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="english">ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ &nbsp; Hello, Let's code together!  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="german">ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª &nbsp; Hallo, lass uns zusammen codieren! </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="tagalog">ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­  &nbsp; Kumusta, Magkasama tayong mag-code! </TabItem>
</Tabs>
